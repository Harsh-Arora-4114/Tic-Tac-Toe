Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that is simple to implement using the C programming language. 
Below is a brief overview of how to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C, including essential components and a basic structure.

Key Components
1. Game Board: Represented as a 3x3 matrix (2D array), where each cell can be empty, 'X', or 'O'.
2. Player Turns: Alternating turns between Player 1 ('X') and Player 2 ('O').

Game Logic:
1. Check for a win condition (three identical symbols in a row, column, or diagonal).
2. Check for a draw condition (all cells filled without a winner).
3. User Input: Allow players to enter their moves.
4. Display Function: Show the current state of the game board.
